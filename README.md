The purpose of this application is to allow a user to create artwork and/or patterns by filling a grid with different colored cells.

A user is presented with a grid of cells. The user will be able to select a color from a set of given colors, in the form of a button for each color. Once selected, the user can click on a single cell within the grid to fill that cell with the selected color. The user will also be provided with a button that will reset all cells to empty, so that the user can start the process over again.
